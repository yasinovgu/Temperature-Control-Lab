# Temperature Control Lab
The temperature control lab is an application of feedback control with an Arduino, an LED, two heaters, and two temperature sensors. The heater power output is adjusted to maintain a desired temperature setpoint. Thermal energy from the heater is transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation to the temperature sensor. Heat is also transferred away from the device to the surroundings. This lab is a resource for model identification and controller development.
# 1st Report 
In this report, transfer function of the temperature control lab kit has been identified using method of schwarze and inflection tangent method. 
# 2nd Report 
In this report, a comparison has been made between simulated and experimental results. It is observed that the obtained transfer function G(s) describes the process behaviour with relatively high
accuracy.
# 3rd Report
Gain adjustment has been done using loopshapin. Then PID controllers have been tuned using Ziegler tuning rules, T-Sum rules, and Oppelt tuning rules. Finally, those parameters havve been used to observe the performance on temperature control lab kit, along with manipulated disturbances and set point changes. 
# 4th Report
In this report, monitoring the process using OPC UA model notation has been used through configuring the given access by Professor to OPC UA server.
